# Clustering-Assignment
"Clustering" involves the application of a machine learning technique to a dataset containing various features. These features represent different attributes or characteristics of the data points. The dataset could encompass a wide range of domains, such as customer demographics, product attributes, or biological measurements.

Before applying clustering algorithms, it's crucial to understand the features present in the dataset and their relevance to the clustering task. These features serve as the basis for determining similarities or dissimilarities between data points.

During the clustering process, the algorithm aims to group similar data points together into clusters, with the number of clusters often specified beforehand. This number can be determined through various methods, such as domain knowledge, elbow method, or silhouette analysis.

The silhouette score is a metric used to evaluate the quality of clustering results. It measures how well each data point fits within its assigned cluster compared to other clusters. A higher silhouette score indicates better-defined clusters, with values ranging from -1 to 1, where 1 represents dense, well-separated clusters.

In summary, clustering involves analyzing a dataset with various features to group similar data points into clusters, with the number of clusters determined beforehand and evaluated using metrics such as silhouette score.
